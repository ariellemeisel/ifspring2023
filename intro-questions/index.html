            <h1> Introduction Questions </h1>
            <ol>
                <li>I’m Arielle (she/her), I’m a sophomore majoring in architecture and minoring in CS and HCI.</li>

                <li>So far on the HCI path I’ve only taken Visual Principles for the Screen, but I’ve done a bit of web design before on no-code platforms like Wix. I’ve also taken a few CS classes now but haven’t learned HTML/CSS. I’ve always wanted to learn HTML/CSS because it would allow me to do so much more in design, and I think it’s so cool that it’s a direct application of coding where all progress is visual and immediate (yay for easy debugging!) </li>
                
                <li>No, guess I got ahead of this question!</li>
            
                <li>I hope to learn how to implement interactive elements in a site, maybe even incorporating algorithms like search, sort, or filter I have no idea how complicated this is to achieve so it may be way out of my league for this semester though.</li>
                
                <li>I’m actually more used to designing for a screen than for paper, but from my past experience, the biggest difference is probably in how colors and text size appear. For these reasons, I think designing for a screen is actually easier, because you see elements exactly as they will appear to the user.</li>
                
                <li>Baggu’s website is simple and intuitive, but still memorable and fun. I feel like it effectively encapsulates the ethos of the company, advertises their products, and appeals to their target audience. The consistency across branding elements is immaculate — from the photography, to typefaces, to layouts, to copy, to interactive elements, everything is cohesive and encapsulates the designs of their products.

                <li>Kounkey Design Initiative is an interdisciplinary architecture, planning, and design firm with a conscience. The website is very clear and succinct in its communication, making the firm’s complex mission and approach to design very accessible and approachable. Just from a few bits of well-crafted text on the homepage, visitors can learn exactly what KDI is and does, and then navigating to the “about” page reveals a well-organized set of pages that provide information in much greater detail.

                <li>I feel like the most obvious thing I have to point out about Pinterest is that its search function just works so much better than Google’s for certain types of searches — if I’m looking for a recipe, design ideas, or creative solutions, I know I’m going to find it on Pinterest, and I’m going to find many options. I may only find a couple on Google and besides, the results are manipulated by ads/SEO. Pinterest’s algorithm of tailoring results to my search history works so well that at this point, I don’t really need to search for anything anymore, it just comes up on my feed. And of course it’s very convenient and easy to save images, unlike with Google.
