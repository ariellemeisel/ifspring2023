                <p> Title: Poppyseed Cake </p>
                <p> Description: A Wintner family tradition, this is the perfect cake that pleases everyone: 
                    it's moist but light with just the right level of sweetness, and it has a delicious golden-brown carmelized top. 
                    Kind of like pound cake, but better. It's baked in a bundt pan for even baking and easy slicing. </p>
                <p> Servings: 16 (more like 10-12 if you cut generous slices like Grandma Sue) </p>
                <p> Prep time: 20 min </p>

                <p> *I tried really hard to search for my own images of when we've made it but I could not find any yet. 
                    I would use images of the cake as well as maybe a photo of my grandma, who started the tradition, 
                    and maybe simple illustrations for each step. </p>

                <h3> Three links to recipe websites you have found, with a short (2-3 sentences) written review/critique for each, explaining what makes this site a good reference </h3>

                    <a href = "https://tastecooking.com/recipes/crispy-potato-ribbons-clothbound-cheddar/"> Taste Cooking by Penguin Random House. </a> 
                    The recipe page cuts all the junk out of blogs, so it's concise, compact to view on a computer screen or tablet, and clearly prioritizes information. 
                    It's interactive, breaking down all the steps for you so it's easy to track your progress and not quite so overwhelming. Plus, it's pretty.

                    Likewise, this site has a compact layout for the recipe, giving you only the most relevant and important information. 
                    It's all easy to read and can even fit on one screen without scrolling.
                    You can also check off ingredients to keep track of progress.

                    This one is also pretty concise and clear. It feels like a luxurious, elevated experience. 
                    There aren't any distractions on the page except a video player to the right of the text.

                        <a href = "https://chamberlaincoffee.com/"> Chamberlain Coffee </a>. This site implements very effective world-building 
                        through cohesive branding consisting of certain typefaces, illustrations, colors, product photography, and other graphic 
                        elements that are repeated in various iterations. The site is also very whimsical, and the copy reflects this too. 
                        Overall, it is an immersive environment that makes me want to continue spending time on it.

                        <a href = "https://www.notion.so/product"> Notion. </a> I like this site for similar reasons: cohesive branding that's unique and 
                        memorable but also accessible and clear, whimsical illustrations, and effective world-building. It's also interesting how little 
                        color is used, yet the site is anything but boring.

                        <a href = "https://goodonyou.eco/"> Good on You. </a> It's a database of information regarding sustainable and ethical practices 
                        of thousands of clothing brands, but it doesn't feel overwhelming at all. The design is simple and understated, 
                        yet somehow unique and memorable. It clearly communicates important information through text hierarchy, streamlined layouts, and 
                        simplified face icons that are quick and easy indicators of a brand's overall ranking.

Over the next few weeks, you will be designing and building a web page that presents a recipe. We'll start that project by finding/choosing a recipe, and doing some design research. This week, you will upload an HTML document that presents the following:


Sample imagery (this may or may not be actual images from your recipe source, it might instead be samples of photos/illustrations representing the type of images you intend to use)
Three links to recipe websites you have found, with a short (2-3 sentences) written review/critique for each, explaining what makes this site a good reference
